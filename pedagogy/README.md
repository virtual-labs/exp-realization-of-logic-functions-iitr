#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expositry
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description: </b> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
This experiment is for designing and realization of logic functions using NAND/NOR gate. Firstly, the user will select a particular gate for simulations. Then simulator screen will display a circuit diagram with incomplete connections using NAND/ NOR gate. User will have to complete those connections and check the particular circuit to realize its logic function.
